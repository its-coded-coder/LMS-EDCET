Ways to contribute
==================


Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every
little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

Talk to us
----------

* Get support in our `Community Forums <http://community.learningequality.org/>`__.
* Email us at info@learningequality.org
* Visit the ``#kolibri`` room on Freenode IRC

Translate
---------

Help us `translate the application on Crowdin <https://crowdin.com/project/kolibri>`__.

Give feedback
-------------

You can ask questions, make suggestions, and report issues in the `community forums <https://community.learningequality.org/>`__.

If you are proposing a new feature or giving feedback on an existing feature:

* Explain in detail what you're trying to do and why the existing system isn't working for you
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to understand the specific problem you're trying to address

If you have found a bug and are comfortable using Github and Markdown, you can create a `Github issue <https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/issues>`__. Please search the existing issues first to see if it's already been reported.

Please make sure to use the template. Replace the HTML comments (the ``<!-- ... -->``) with the information requested.

Write code
----------

Before your first contribution, please make sure to check out :ref:`getting_started`. In addition to that, :ref:`howtos` have step by step guides for common tasks in getting started and working on Kolibri.

We encourage you to visit `Kolibri GitHub Discussions <https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/discussions>`__ to ask questions about contributing to Kolibri, troubleshoot development server issues, or connect with other contributors.

Even though you're welcome to ask for an assignment of any issue you find interesting, we recommend especially issues tagged as `help wanted <https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/labels/TAG%3A%20help%20wanted>`__. If you're looking for your first issue or a smaller, self-contained issue, issues tagged as `beginner friendly <https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/labels/TAG%3A%20beginner%20friendly>`__ are a good place to start.

For questions related to a specific issue or assignment requests, feel free to use the issue's comment section. Note that in times of increased contributor activity, it may take us a few days to reply. If you don't hear from us within a week, please reach out through `Kolibri GitHub Discussions <https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/discussions>`__.

Note that since Kolibri is still in development, the APIs are subject to change, and a lot of code is still in flux.

Write documentation
-------------------

If you'd like to help improve Kolibri's `User Documentation <https://kolibri.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__, see the `Kolibri docs Github repo <https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri-docs>`__.

You can also help improve our developer documentation that you're reading now! These are in the main Kolibri repo.

Both our developer docs and the user docs are formatted using `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`__.
