# Contributing

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to Kolibri! The project was founded by volunteers dedicated to helping make educational materials more accessible to those in need, and every contribution makes a difference.

Before your first contribution, please make sure to check out our [Kolibri developer documentation](https://kolibri-dev.readthedocs.io), where you will find detailed guidance on [getting started](https://kolibri-dev.readthedocs.io/en/develop/getting_started.html), [how-to guides](https://kolibri-dev.readthedocs.io/en/develop/howtos/index.html), and much more.

We encourage you to visit [Kolibri GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/discussions) to ask questions about contributing to Kolibri, troubleshoot development server issues, or connect with other contributors.

Even though you're welcome to ask for an assignment of any issue you find interesting, we recommend especially issues tagged as [help wanted](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/labels/TAG%3A%20help%20wanted). If you're looking for your first issue or a smaller, self-contained issue, issues tagged as [beginner friendly](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/labels/TAG%3A%20beginner%20friendly) are a good place to start.

For questions related to a specific issue or assignment requests, feel free to use the issue's comment section. Note that in times of increased contributor activity, it may take us a few days to reply. If you don't hear from us within a week, please reach out through [Kolibri GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/discussions).
